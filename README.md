# Address-Book
Creating an Address Book File System



Project Overview:

â€‹This purpose of this project was to create a file based database to store and update a contact / address list.  This was a final project in my database systems class.   The project was to be completed using an object oriented design in C++.   

The final project contains two classes:  create_record and address_book.

The create_record class creates/populates a text file in the proper format for the address_book class to use.  The create_record class can also create a transaction file which contains commands to update an existing address book record.  

For more details see the header (.h) and  implementation (.cpp) files below.
